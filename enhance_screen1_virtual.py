"""
Screen 1 Focused Enhancement - Pattern and Root Improvement
=========================================================

Since 5/6 screens are already at 100% readiness, let's focus on maximizing 
Screen 1 (Word Info) which is the main bottleneck at 49.4%.

We need to improve:
- Root coverage: 47.1% -> Target: 90%+ (from CAMeL data)  
- Pattern coverage: 0% -> Target: 60%+ (from morphology)
- Register coverage: 0% -> Target: 40%+ (from POS analysis)

This will bring Screen 1 from 49.4% to ~80%+ and overall readiness to 95%+!
